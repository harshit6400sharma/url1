                                is the amount you are willing to pay, against the losses incurred. This amount
                                determines the annual premium you will pay
                                for your car insurance. Higher the deductible, lower the premiums.</p>
                            <p>The insurance company pays a part of the losses, while the deductible amount chosen by
                                you will be paid by you. For example, if the total expenses you have to bear to get your
                                car repaired after an accident are
                                INR 20,000/-. Your chosen deductible is INR 5,000/-, then the insurance company will pay
                                INR 15,000/- and you will pay INR 5,000/- from your pocket. <br> While buying a car
                                policy, choosing a deductible is an
                                important step as you pay the deductible for each and every situation in which you
                                require your insurance company to cover damages. </p>
                            <p>If you face a grievous situation with your car, simply claim for car insurance and you
                                will be reimbursed as per the eligibility mentioned and add-ons attached with your type

                            <p>It is very important to get your car insured at the earliest. If you already have
                                coverage, get it renewed on time. Whether you go for a cheap car insurance policy like
                                the third party insurance or a bit expensive one like comprehensive
                                car policy, what matters is that your car is insured against all kinds of unforeseen
                                risks.</p>

                            <p>In case you are liable for an accident and damages to someone else's vehicle, this type
                                of insurance comes in force. It is mandatory by law to have a third party insurance
                                cover, before you start driving on roads. Liability insurance
                                will cover the cost of repairs for any third party property damaged by an accident as
                                well as the medical bills for the other person from resulting injuries. This cover is
                                mandatory for all cars. </p>

                            <p>In case you meet with an accident and your car is damaged severely, this cover helps to
                                bear the repair expenses. Also, if the damages are such that the repair expenses are
                                exceeding the total value of the car, the collision cover
                                pays the value of the car. This cover is important for expensive high-end cars. </p>

                                you may face with your car. It covers accidental damages, medical expenses to self and
                                others and also, damages due to weather, natural calamities,
                                car theft, and vandalism, which are not covered in other two insurances, are covered in
                                comprehensive cover. It is not compulsory by law to have comprehensive coverage, but if
                                it suits your budget, it is one of the most important
                                insurance policies to have in your kitty if you are a regular driver. It can further be
                                enhances by adding on the riders like NCB (No Claim Bonus), accessories cover, invoice
                                cover etc. With the all-inclusive features that this
                                cover comes with, it is expensive than the rest two.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Based on Vehicle -</strong> Get your car inspected before you choose a
                                        policy. Depending on the age, brand, make, model and fuel of your car, compare
                                        car insurance online plans and go for the one which offers all inclusive
                                        plan in a lower premium. </p>
                                    <p><strong>Based on Claims History -</strong> Claimless policies lead to no claim
                                        bonus the following year which means you pay a lower premium. Make sure you do
                                        not claim petty amounts for small accidental repair. </p>
                                    <p><strong>Based on Driver-</strong> Keep your car a single user drive. A vehicle
                                        driven by multiple people attracts higher premiums.</p>

                                    <h3>How To Reduce Premium? </h3>
                                    <p>If you choose a higher deductible (amount to be paid from your own pocket in case
                                        of accidental repairs), the premium goes down.<br> If your car has in-built
                                        security features, approved by Automotive Research Association of
                                        India (ARAI), you enjoy further discounts on premium. <br> Not filing for claims
                                        consecutively for 3-4 years can lead to a no claim bonus of as much as 40-50%
                                        lesser premium in the fifth year!
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Precautions - Do not make these mistakes while buying car insurance </h3>
                                    <p>Declaring reduced value of the car in the insurance form may reduce the premium
                                        initially, but in case of an accident or theft, this proves real costly, as the
                                        insurance provider will settle the claims as per IDV (insured declared
                                        value), only. Hence, always try to provide the right value of the car to gain
                                        maximum claim benefits. <br> Never forget to renew your policy in time. You get
                                        a grace period of a week from policy expiry date. Post that,
                                        you lose discounts and other lowered premium benefits!</p>

                            </h2>
                            <p>Car Insurance Renewal is one of the most important, thoughtful and responsible steps to
                                take, in order to keep your car safe and your expenses in check. In case your car
                                insurance policy has expired or about to expire, it is very easy
                                to get it renewed at your insurer's website or at thepolicymall.com. Always remember that
                                switching to another insurer or renewing your policy with the same insurer, both will be
                                hassle-free and easy processes if you do it before
                                your policy expires or within the grace period.</p>
                            <p><strong>What is Grace Period?</strong> <br> Some insurance providers offer grace period
                                which allows you a time of 3 to 30 days after the your policy expired, to get it renewed
                                without a lot of additional cost.Â Do not overuse it or
                                take undue advantage of it. Use it only when you absolutely need it. Some insurers may
                                levy a late fee for using the grace period. The point to remember is that not all
                                companies offer a grace period. You must make sure at the
                                time of buying the policy, whether you are entitled to grace period or not. If you have
                                missed the renewal before expiry or within the grace period, you can still get it
                                renewed, but with a little more effort and a little more
                                money.
