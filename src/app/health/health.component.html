                                        medical emergencies. Health insurance can help you buy time to make
                                        hospitalisation payments. Even if you have to somehow pay from your own pocket
                                        initially, due to any reason, you can always claim it back.</p>

                                    </h2>
                                    <p>There are multiple health insurance companies and each one has different health
                                        plans to offer.</p>
                                    <p>Primarily, Health Insurance is entirely based on individual needs and priorities.
                                        If you don’t compare health insurance plans and buy the first policy you come
                                        across, then you might lose out on some important benefits or lower
                                        premiums.

                                    <p>Different health plans offer you different sum insured. This depends not only on
                                        your age, health conditions, lifestyle etc., but also on the insurer’s pricing
                                        strategies and risk taking abilities. More the sum insured
                                        you’re offered, less you pay from your own pocket in times of crisis. Comparing
                                        health plans would ensure that you get the best coverage amount given your

                                    <p>This is a feature in all major health plans under which the insured agrees to pay
                                        a fraction of the total medical cost from own pocket and the balance amount will
                                        be paid out of the insurance policy. For example, if the
                                        policy states a co-pay of 10%, then the insured will pay 10% of the total cost
                                        of hospitalisation and balance 90% will be paid out of his insured sum. Each
                                        plan has different terms and conditions regarding co-pay so
                                        comparing them make it beneficial for the insured to get the best deal.</p>

                                        When it comes to pre-existing disease, there is a waiting period so as to lower
                                        their exposure to risks. However, this waiting period varies
                                        for every insurance plan. Comparing helps to choose the plan with lowest waiting
                                        period or no waiting period at all!</p>

                                        policy has set a sub-limit of Rs. 40,000/- on kidney surgery, then
                                        you can only avail that amount as claim and will have to bear the remaining cost
                                        out of your own pocket. Better to compare different plans and select the one

                                    <p>Health insurance renewal is very important. You insurance company will send you a
                                        reminder prior to the date of expiry, but you also must be aware of the date,
                                        when the renewal is needed, so that it can be done in time.</p>
                                    <p>A timely renewal of health insurance policy will ensure that you do not lose the
                                        benefits such as waiting periods and NCBs (No Claim Bonus). If you fail to renew
                                        the policy in time, your policy will lapse and you will lose
                                        any continuation benefits.</p>

                                <h3>How do you apply for medical insurance portability?</h3>
                                <p>In case you do not feel sufficed by the services of your existing insurance provider,
                                    or the list of network hospitals is not up to your expectations, or the sum assured
                                    doesn't compensate your medical expenses, you can apply for
                                    portability by submitting a written request to new insurance provider. This must be
                                    done at least 45 days prior to the expiry of existing medical plan. In case all the
                                    portability conditions are met, you get your medical insurance
                                    ported within 15 days.</p>
