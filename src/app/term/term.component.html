                                                will have to pay lower premium than the person buying at the age of 50

                                                than men. Which means that the insurance company gets premiums for a
                                                longer period, hence, the lower amount.</p>

                                                of premium. However, if one buys a short-term plan, it will result in an

                                    <p>One of the least discussed topics in your younger days is death. Well, quite
                                        rightly that’s a topic that most of us should avoid any ways. But it comes along
                                        with an uncertainty which one should not ignore under any circumstance.
                                        In our younger days, when we have fewer responsibilities, we don’t think much
                                        about our liabilities. Or what would happen to our loved ones, should the
                                        unexpected happen. In order to counter these uncertainties, one should
                                        buy a term insurance. </p>
                                    <p>A term plan is the most basic form of insurance that provides you pure
                                        protection. Protection being the only priority, makes it a product worth
                                        investing time and money in. If you have decided to purchase a term insurance,
                                        you would need some documents to complete the process. The following guide would
                                        help you out with all those documents.</p>

                                        <p>As your policy expires, you will stop paying monthly premium. But if you want
                                            to, you can extend the same policy by paying annual premium on it. The
                                            premium rates may increase in this case. Go for this option only if you
                                            are ageing and want to extend your policy only for a few years. You may want
                                            to reduce the death benefit amount for reduced premiums.</p>

                                        <p>Most term insurance policies come with an option of conversion where you can
                                            convert your term life insurance plan to a permanent one or an endowment
                                            plan (to get a lump sum amount on maturity of plan) . If you are not
                                            medically fit and not eligible for a new policy, then conversion is the best
                                            option to go for. Be informed that some policies permit conversion any time
                                            before expiry date, while others might allow during a specific
                                            period or age. </p>

                                        You must also look into the background of the insurance provider
