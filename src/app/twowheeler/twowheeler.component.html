                                <p>A two wheeler insurance policy is one that helps you to cover financial expenses
                                    against any unforeseen circumstances including accidents, thefts or natural
                                    disasters, if you are an owner of a two wheeler/bike. It is not
                                    optional, but mandatory under the Motor Vehicles Act to have your two wheeler
                                    covered under an insurance policy. When you buy a new vehicle, the seller adds the
                                    cost of an insurance cover in the total cost as a premium,
                                    which is valid for one year. After one year, you can get your policy renewed with
                                    the same insurance provider or you can buy a new policy with a different insurance
                                    provider. <br> Depending upon the kind of insurance
                                    policy you choose and add-ons you select, the two wheeler insurance policy works for

                                        premium goes up. This is because the insurers consider you
                                        a high-risk customer and charge you hefty premium. Ensure you file claims only
                                        for expensive damages or repairs.</li>

                                        Do remember that NCB starts at 20% at the end of first

                            <p>Even after the policy has expired, you still have a small window, called grace period, to
                                get it renewed. This can vary between 3 and 30 days after the expiry date and not every
                                insurer offers this period. Also, certain insurers
                                may offer free renewal during this period and some may levy charges. Follow these steps
                                if your policy lies within grace period:</p>
                            <ul class="list2">
                                <li>Check the late fee, if any, and make that payment</li>
                                <li>Clear all past dues and pending premiums</li>

                                    want to add to your renewed policy</li>
                                <li>Submit the required details to the insurer, make the payment either online or
                                    through an agent and the renewed policy will be delivered to you</li>

                            <p>
                                If you failed to renew the policy within the grace period, your two wheeler insurance
                                policy dies. If there is a significant loss of time after the expiry, you may not be
                                eligible for a renewal with the same insurer. You may have to buy a new policy
                                altogether.
